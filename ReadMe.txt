I have used react for implementing this assignment. I have attached demo json file also for reference 'file.json'.
Steps to run application:
	1. npm install
	2. npm start
Brief about the app:-
	1. App contains ability to add components like singleline question answer,
multiline textbox of lenght 500 characters, and single choice question.
	2. We can reset the complete form by clicking on reset form button.
	3. I have stored user entered values also. User can change option values or can add new questions dynamically.
	4. All user inputs along with form data will get downloaded in valid json format by clicking on download JSON button.
